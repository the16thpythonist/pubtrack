# I dont really know what this is doing but here is my educated guess. So the whole s2i process creates a new docker
# container from a source repository. This means at some point the source repository needs to be cloned. I am assuming
# the source code is inside the /tmp/src folder. And then obviously we need to move it to the place where it is actually
# supposed to be as per the requirement of the application code.
# In this case I looked into the docker file (on which all of this is supposed to be based) and it puts all the code
# into the /code folder...
